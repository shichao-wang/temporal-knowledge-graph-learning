# Dataset
Many work release their data accompanied with code. 
We download the dataset from multiple repositories, and convert theirs into our format.
Each dataset contains 3 files: train.tsv, val.tsv and test.tsv.
There are 4 columns in each file, represent subject(head), relation, object(tail), time(moment) respectively.
